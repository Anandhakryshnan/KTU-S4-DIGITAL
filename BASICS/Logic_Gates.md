# A logic gate 
is an idealized or physical device implementing a Boolean function, that is, it performs a
logical operation on one or more logic inputs and produces a single logic. There are seven basic logic
gates: AND, OR, XOR, NOT, NAND, NOR, and XNOR.
# The AND gate 
is so named because, if 0 is called "false" and 1 is called "true," the gate acts in the
same way as the logical "and" operator. The output is "true" when both inputs are "true." Otherwise,
the output is "false."
# The OR gate 
gets its name from the fact that it behaves after the fashion of the logical inclusive "or."
The output is "true" if either or both of the inputs are "true." If both inputs are "false," then the output
is "false."
# A NOT gate 
sometimes called a logical inverter to differentiate it from other types of electronic
inverter devices, has only one input. It reverses the logic state
# The NAND gate 
operates as an AND gate followed by a NOT gate. It acts in the manner of the
logical operation "and" followed by negation. The output is "false" if both inputs are "true."
Otherwise, the output is "true."
# The NOR gate 
is a combination OR gate followed by an inverter. Its output is "true" if both inputs are
"false." Otherwise, the output is "false."
# The XOR(exclusive-OR) gate 
acts in the same way as the logical "either/or." The output is "true" if
either, but not both, of the inputs are "true." The output is "false" if both inputs are "false" or if both
inputs are "true." Another way of looking at this circuit is to observe that the output is 1 if the inputs
are different, but 0 if the inputs are the same.
# The XNOR (exclusive-NOR) gate 
is a combination XOR gate followed by an inverter. Its output is
"true" if the inputs are the same, and"false" if the inputs are different
